-The grammar I have corrected and it is visible in git commits changes. 

-Everything marked in red is there for deeper understanding of the problem. 

-I added the abstract it was not in the .tex file

-You dont have any state-of-the-art section and it is usually the most important part. 
It is there to give insight to the reader what is the best what is done in that field.
This is followed by related work (you called it previous work) and there you have to write how others have done it.
If its too difficoult then dont do it, but it makes the work seem more researched and you can show your understanding for the topic... 

-The biggest problem here is - so far as I can see - that you don't quite get for what every paragraph stands for.
My suggestion is to take some time - really take some time, a day or so - and to read about it on the internet.
For example google: what is related work for and how to write it? 

-You definetly have enough good information in this work, it just needs structure. 

-Way to many references for the number of pages. it is your work and you use a reference only when you don't have any chouce.
I would not use more than 6 in your work. But this is maybe nitpicking.

if you have any questions you can txt or call me....
